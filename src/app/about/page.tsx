                <p>
                    This project is the result of several months of work. Initially, I thought I could complete it sooner, but technical challenges and pauses in development while working with technologies like <strong>Next.js</strong> and <strong>Supabase</strong>, as well as the need to find alternative approaches for specific functions, extended the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, I managed to complete it thanks to perseverance and the support of my friends, family, and especially AKMU, whose music accompanied me during my development sessions, listening to their albums over and over again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also want to thank James Clear for his book "Atomic Habits," which provided me with the necessary tools to establish and maintain positive habits that were crucial in this process. Thanks to the combination of good music and good reading, I was able to stay focused and motivated until the end.
